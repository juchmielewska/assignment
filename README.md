MODEL: Random Forest Classification

       This model was chosen because: 
     - it is used to classify data, which means it can predict binary outcomes. Thus, in the case of predicting the outcome of a match, it was used to classify who would win.
     
     - It supports different types of data, such as numeric, categorical and textual. So it could be used for a variety of information, such as the results of previous matches, the form of the players, the venue, the history of matches between teams and many other factors to help predict the winner.

     - It also has the ability to deal with large data sets and variables, which is important when predicting the outcome of a match, as there can be many factors affecting the outcome of a match.
